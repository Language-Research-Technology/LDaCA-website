The corpus is divided into four time periods (1788–1825, 1826–1850, 1851–1875 and 1876–1900) each holding about 500,000 words. Four registers were defined for CoOEE: the Speech-based Register (SB), the Private Written Register (PrW), the Public Written Register (PcW) and the register of Government English (GE). In every Period 1-4 there is a similar number of words in the different registers. Sydney Speaks: This project seeks to document and explore Australian English, as spoken in Australia’s largest and most ethnically and linguistically diverse city – Sydney. From Farms to Freeways: This research project sought to analyse the experiences of women who had lived in the Blacktown and Penrith areas since the early 1950s, including their responses to social changes brought about by rapid suburbanisation in the Western Sydney region in the post-war period. Two-hour taped discussions were held with 34 women, aged sixty and over, who were in their early twenties during the Western Sydney region’s population growth. These datasets can be explored through the development version of the LDaCA search interface. Simple access control is implemented in this prototype; this applies to data from Sydney Speaks which is not freely accessible. In the interface, you will also see information about a collection of government documents in various languages.

For my postgraduate research, I documented and described grammatical topics of Sudest (known as Vanga Vanatɨna by its speakers), an Oceanic language spoken in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The language is spoken on the islands of Vanatinai (also known as Sudest and Tagula) and Yeina in the Louisiade Archipelago, approximately 350 kilometres southeast of the PNG mainland. In the following, I discuss decisions I made and processes I followed related to the collection of language data and archiving the resulting corpus of texts, including ethical considerations, ownership of the data, data formats, metadata, and data security and reuse. This is by no means meant as a guide (of best practice) for projects where language data are being collected with speakers of un(der)described languages. Rather, it is an account of some of the types of considerations and procedures that need to be considered when collecting language data and how I handled them in this instance. Before recording with a speaker for the first time, I would explain the project to the speaker and their rights as contributors to the project. I would explain how I would use the language recordings, how they would be stored and accessed and how speakers of the language or other researchers might access and use the recordings in the future. This included discussing how they, the person(s) making the recording, would retain ownership over the recording (i.e., intellectual and cultural property rights). They would also be the ones to choose access rights over the text and have the option to withdraw any or all recordings they made from the corpus at any point (more on these below). After these discussions, if the speaker was still interested in the project, I would then record an oral consent form with them. The consent form was in English, the language of wider communication in the province. In cases where the speaker didn’t speak or spoke limited English, we would have a translator present for this process. I chose to use an oral consent form as it is accessible to all participants no matter their literacy levels. It also has the advantage of being a more durable format compared with a paper consent form, particularly when working in a hot and humid climate and it can also be easily backed up. Each time I made a recording with a speaker or speakers, I played the recording back to them to check that they were happy with the recording and so that they could decide on what sort of access conditions they wanted the archived recording to have. If the speaker was not satisfied with the recording, sometimes they would choose to make another recording and delete the original or simply delete the recording and maybe try again later. If they were happy with the recording, they would decide on the access conditions they wanted for the archived recording. The possibilities ranged from the most restricted, being that only I, as the original researcher, could access the recordings and use them for my research, to the opposite end of the access continuum where anyone interested could download and listen to the recordings, read any transcriptions, and potentially use them for educational or research purposes. In between these two ends of the continuum, they could opt for other access conditions such as only allowing access for registered users of the archive, or only for researchers and speakers, or just for speakers. They could also choose to have a text embargoed for a certain period of time. When I was preparing my ethics application for the university, I applied and received ethics approval to work with minors. I didn’t plan to collect data from children (although I did want the option of recording older teens if any showed an interest in recording), but included min","date":"15 Feb 2022","objectID":"/fieldwork-png/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Fieldwork PNG","uri":"/fieldwork-png/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Principles Information about the principles on which the work of LDaCA is based.

High quality metadata is important in making data FAIR: Findable: metadata is the starting point for searching data collections. For example, if we want to find data in a particular language, this will only be possible for data which has a language recorded in its metadata. (Tracking languages is in itself problematic, see below.) Accessible: access conditions which apply to data should be part of the associated metadata. Interoperable: information about the format of data and whether it requires specific software to be usable should be part of the associated metadata. Reusable: all of aspects of metadata mentioned above contribute to making data reusable. The more we know about some data, the easier it is to know whether it will be useful to us or not. RO-Crates in general have basic metadata requirements, but it is possible to specify a profile for crates for specific purposes. LDaCA is developing such a profile for our data; we are basing this largely on previous work in the area. An important aspect of the RO-Crate approach is that it uses the principles of Linked Open Data. This means that terms used in our metadata will (whenever possible) link to an openly available definition. In developing the profile, we are drawing on two existing attempts to provide vocabularies for describing language data.

This is not a simple problem because the relationship between languages and names for them is not one to one. Some languages have more than one name: for example Farsi and Persian can both be used to refer to the same language. Some names refer to more than one language: for example there are languages called Buru used in Nigeria and in Indonesia. To avoid the confusion which can arise from such situations, various systems have been developed to assign unique identifiers to languages. None of these systems gives a comprehensive list of languages and all such systems struggle with another problem, the distinction between separate languages and dialects of one language, as can be seen in the case study below. LDaCA includes identifiers from each of the three systems below where they are available and relevant. ISO-639 This system is recognised as a standard by the International Standards Organisation. An earlier version of this system used two-letter codes to identify languages; more recent versions use three-letter codes (referred to as ISO 639-3). These codes are used by Ethnologue, which is a catalogue of the languages of the world, and in many other contexts. The ISO 639-3 code for French is fra, and that for Warlpiri is wbp Glottolog Glottolog is an alternative catalogue of the world’s languages, language families and dialects - Glottolog uses the term languoid to cover all of these. Each languoid is assigned a unique identifier consisting of four alphanumeric characters and four digits. For example, (standard) French has the code stan1290, amd Warlpiri is warl1254. Austlang AustLang provides a controlled vocabulary of persistent identifiers, a thesaurus of languages and peoples, and information about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages which has been assembled from referenced sources. Alphanumeric codes are used as persistent identifiers, while associated text strings are changeable and can reflect community preferences (including alternative names and spellings). In Austlang, Warlpiri has two codes: C15 for the language in general, and C15.1 for the variety named as Wakirti Warlpiri. (French is not covered by Austlang.)

The language has several dialects or varieties and the table below shows how the different code schemes deal with this.

RO-Crate is a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata. It is based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wide variety of situations. While RO-Crates can be considered general-purpose containers of arbitrary data and open-ended metadata, in practical use within a particular domain, application or framework, it is beneficial to further constrain RO-Crate to a specific profile: a set of conventions, types and properties that one minimally can require and expect to be present in that subset of RO-Crates. LDaCA is developing such a profile to be used for language data.

But the rest of the world are bringing with them new approaches to how data is handled. This means that fields such as corpus linguistics may need to reassess their practices. Such reassessment includes addressing concerns about how data is stored and who can access it (data stewardship) – concerns that are a part of the Open Science movement, ultimately grounded on principles of equity and accountability. The most influential approach to data stewardship today is the FAIR principles. According to these principles, data should be: Findable Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Accessible Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation. Interoperable The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. Reusable The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings. In general, corpus linguists do well on the interoperability criterion. Corpus data is usually stored in non-proprietary formats; even when some structure is imposed on the data, this is almost always in a form which is saved as a simple text file (e.g. csv files or xml annotations). Data stored in such formats is easy to move between applications. But what about the other three criteria? Some corpus data is easy to discover; it is findable. For example CLARIN, the portal to the European Union language resource infrastructure, provides access to many large data collections, as does the Linguistic Data Consortium in the USA. However, some data is never made part of a large collection and often remains under the control of individual researchers or research teams. Such data may be almost impossible to find. Even if we can find such data, it is unlikely to be accompanied by good descriptions of the data and metadata, making reusability problematic. Of course, big corpora such as the British National Corpus will be both findable and accompanied by comprehensive corpus manuals. However, it is worth considering how to make other corpora more findable, including the provision of corpus manuals or corpus descriptions. Corpus resource databases such as CoRD do aim to work towards this principle. Accessibility may also be an issue for some data. Copyright law may allow use of material for individual research but prohibit any further distribution of the material. The FAIR approach to such cases is that metadata should be available so that interested parties can know that a data holding exists (F), and the metadata will include information about the conditions under which the data may or may not be shared or reused (A and R). Image from Global Indigenous Data Alliance (https://www.gida-global.org/) For linguists, there is another very important set of principles concerning data, the CARE principles developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance: Collective Benefit Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data. Authority to control Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered. Responsibility Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ self-determination and collective benefit. Ethics Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem. These principles are presented as applying particularly to Indigenous data, but we believe t","date":"08 Feb 2022","objectID":"/fair-and-care/:0:0","tags":["FAIR","CARE"],"title":"What are the FAIR and CARE principles and why should corpus linguists know about them?","uri":"/fair-and-care/"}]
